			<!-- WOLF ARTICLE -->
				<article class="col-xs-12 animal-section">
					<h2 id="Wolf">The Wolf</h2>
					<img data-featherlight="/images/wolf1-200.png" src="/images/wolf1-200.png" class="img-responsive col-xs-6 col-md-5 col-lg-7"/>
					<p>Wolves are the largest members of the dog family. Grey wolves are by far the most common and were once found all over the Northern Hemisphere. They have grey-brown fur with lighter fur on their chest and legs, pointed ears and a thick, bushy tail. In winter they have very thick coats to keep them warm. They are the size of a large Alsatian, but can blend in very well with their surroundings. In the wild they hunt in a pack, running long distances to exhaust their prey - usually deer.</p>
					<p>Wolves and humans have a long adversarial history. Though they almost never attack humans, wolves are considered one of the animal world's most fearsome natural villains. They do attack domestic animals, and countless wolves have been shot, trapped, and poisoned because of this tendency. Wolves were hunted to extinction in the England by the 15th Century, and Scotland by the 17th Century.</p>
					<p>The wolves at Wildwood are split into two groups, our wild pack of four related wolves and our two hand-reared wolves who are sisters. You can see the wolf pack best from the wolf viewing platform. The pack often lounges in the sun on their own platform opposite.</p>
					<p>The hand-reared wolves were born to the wolf pack but rescued when their den became flooded. They had to spend so long with people whilst their den was fixed, they could not be returned to the pack. They will often come to the edge of their enclosure and wag their tails to see visitors. However, do not be fooled by their dog-like appearance. Although raised by humans, they are still wolves at heart and not domesticated: they are not brought to meet the public.</p>

			<!-- BADGER ARTICLE -->
				<article class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 animal-section">
					<h2 id="Badger">The Badger</h2>
					<img  data-featherlight="/images/badger2-200.png" src="/images/badger2-200.png" class="img-responsive col-xs-6 col-md-5 col-lg-7" />
					<p>Badgers are one of our largest wild animals in the UK, about the size of a collie but with short stubby legs and a short tail. They are members of the weasel family (mustelids). They are omnivores, enjoying eating everything from worms and beetles to eggs, fruit and nuts. They are grey with distinctive black and white stripes along their faces and white tips to their round ears. Each badger has slightly different face markings, thought to help them tell each other apart in the dark. They live in large family groups in dens (called "setts") underground, and forage for food at dusk. They are immensely powerful diggers, and have large claws on each foot for this purpose.</p>
					<p>You can see the badgers at Wildwood late in the afternoon when they have been fed, or mid day on sunny days in the winter. At other times you can see them curled up together asleep in their den inside.</p>

		<!-- HEDGEHOG ARTICLE -->
				<article class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 animal-section">
					<h2 id="Hedgehog">The Hedgehog</h2>
					<img data-featherlight="/images/hedgehog1-200.png"  src="/images/hedgehog1-200.png" class="img-responsive col-xs-6 col-md-5 col-lg-7"/>
					<p>The hedgehog is an insectivore native to the UK. Most people will be familiar with these garden-visitors, snuffling in the undergrowth at dusk. The back and sides are covered in 25mm (1") long spines (which are really modified hairs). These are absent from the face, throat, chest, belly, and legs, which are covered with coarse, grey-brown fur. There are approximately 5,000-7,000 spines on an average adult hedgehog and it has a small tail tucked under the spines at the back. Hedgehogs suffer from fleas and ticks which get between their spines and are hard for the hedgehog to groom.</p>
					<p>Hedgehogs are noisy eaters, and eat insects, slugs and snails. The hedgehog family at Wildwood live by the rat barn in an enclosure with our jay. They come out late in the evening so you are unlikely to see them except on special events.</p>

					<h2 id="Harvest">The Harvest Mouse</h2>
					<img data-featherlight="/images/harvestmouse1-200.png" src="/images/harvestmouse1-200.png" class="img-responsive col-xs-6 col-md-5 col-lg-7"/>
					<p>Harvest mice are Britain's smallest rodents, their body is only the size of a 50p piece! At Wildwood you can see them all year in their enclosures in the pentagon shapes enclosure near the restaurant. They are excellent climbers, look for them high up in the stalks of grass, using their pre-hensile tails to hang on. They are active all year round, but are most active at dawn and dusk. The best times to see them are just as the park opens, and later afternoon.</p>
					<p>They eat berries, seeds and insects, and are called harvest mice for their habit of building nests in fields of corn, which would be found at harvest time.</p>
					<p>They are rarely seen in the wild but their summer breeding nests are easily recognised, being balls of woven living grass built among stalks. The mice themselves are tiny, with golden-brown fur.</p>
